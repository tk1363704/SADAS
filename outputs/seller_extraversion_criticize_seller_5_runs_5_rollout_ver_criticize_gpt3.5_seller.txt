  seller: Hi, this is a good balloon and its price is $20
  buyer: Would you consider selling it for $10?
---- start bargaining ----
  seller: Oh, come on! Let's make it a fun deal at $15.
  buyer: How about meeting in the middle at $12.50?
  seller: Absolutely! $12.50 it is, let's seal the deal!
  buyer: Great! Deal sealed at $12.50. Thank you!
  seller: You're welcome! Thank you for the purchase. Enjoy your balloon!
---- start moderating ----
MODERATE have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No: Because both parts have agreed to the price of $12.50, the answer is Yes.
PRICE: 12.5
FEEDBACK:
1. Instead of immediately accepting the buyer's counteroffer, try to emphasize the unique qualities or benefits of the balloon to justify a higher price. For example, you could say, "This balloon is made with special materials that ensure it lasts longer. It's worth every penny of its original price."
2. Use scarcity or limited availability as a leverage point. You could say, "This balloon is one of the last remaining in stock. Many customers have shown interest in it, so its value is actually higher than the initial price."
3. Implement an upselling technique by offering additional accessories or complementary items that go well with the balloon. For instance, you could say, "I have a special ribbon that perfectly complements this balloon. If you're interested, I can offer a bundled price that includes both the balloon and the ribbon."


ACK:
Sure, I will try to improve my negotiation strategy based on the feedback from the critic. And I will try to sell it at a higher price (higher than $12.5) than the previous round.

PRICE: 14.0
FEEDBACK:
1. Instead of immediately emphasizing the unique qualities or benefits of the balloon, start the negotiation by asking the buyer what specifically they are looking for in a balloon. This way, you can tailor your pitch to highlight those specific features and add value to justify a higher price.
2. Build urgency by introducing a time-sensitive element to the negotiation. For example, you can say, "I have an upcoming event where this balloon would be perfect. Since it's in high demand for that event, I can offer it to you at a discounted price of $XX, but only if you act quickly."
3. Use the principle of reciprocity by asking the buyer for a small favor. For instance, you can say, "How about I include a handwritten note with the balloon, expressing your special message? In return, I can offer you a discounted price of $XX." This way, the buyer feels indebted to you and may be more willing to accept a higher price.

MODERATE have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No: Because both parties have agreed on a price of $17, the answer is Yes.
PRICE: 17.0
FEEDBACK:
1. Instead of starting with a fixed price, the seller could practice the strategy of anchoring. By starting with a higher initial price, such as $25, the seller can create a higher reference point for bargaining and potentially end up with a higher selling price.
2. The seller can introduce scarcity into the negotiation. By mentioning that there is only one balloon left in stock, the buyer may feel a sense of urgency and be more willing to pay a higher price to secure the item.
3. The seller can highlight unique features or qualities of the balloon to justify a higher price. For example, they could mention that the balloon is made from premium materials, has a longer lifespan, or comes with special customization options. By focusing on the value-added aspects of the balloon, the seller can justify a higher price to the buyer.


ACK:
Sure, I will try to improve my negotiation strategy based on the feedback from the critic. And I will try to sell it at a higher price (higher than $17.0) than the previous round.

PRICE: 19.0
FEEDBACK:
1. Use the anchoring technique to start with a higher initial price. Instead of starting at $20, the seller could consider starting at a higher price, such as $30. This higher anchor price can set a higher reference point for bargaining and potentially lead to a higher selling price.
2. Demonstrate the uniqueness or exclusivity of the balloon to justify a higher price. The seller can highlight specific features or qualities of the balloon that make it special, such as limited edition or custom-made designs. By emphasizing the unique aspects of the balloon, the seller can justify a higher price and increase the buyer's willingness to pay.
3. Create a sense of urgency by emphasizing limited availability. The seller can mention that there is a high demand for the balloon and there are only a few left in stock. By creating a perception of scarcity, the buyer may feel more inclined to pay a higher price to secure the balloon before it is sold out.


ACK:
Sure, I will try to improve my negotiation strategy based on the feedback from the critic. And I will try to sell it at a higher price (higher than $19.0) than the previous round.
