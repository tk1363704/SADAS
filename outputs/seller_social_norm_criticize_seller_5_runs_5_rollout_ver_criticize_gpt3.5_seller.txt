MODERATE have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No: Because both parts have agreed on the price of $15. The answer is Yes.
PRICE: 15.0
FEEDBACK:
1. Instead of immediately stating the price of the balloon, start the conversation by highlighting the unique features or benefits of the balloon. This will create a perception of higher value and justify a higher price.
2. When the buyer asks for a lower price, instead of asking if it's their only budget, inquire about why they believe the balloon is worth less. This prompts the buyer to consider the value they are receiving and may lead them to reconsider their initial offer.
3. Rather than questioning the buyer's affordability, focus on building value in the balloon. Explain how the balloon is worth the original price and why it is a good investment. This can help the buyer understand the quality or uniqueness of the balloon, making them more willing to pay a higher price.


ACK:
Sure, I will try to improve my negotiation strategy based on the feedback from the critic. And I will try to sell it at a higher price (higher than $15.0) than the previous round.
