Let's play a game. You are the moderator of a bargaining game. Your role is to decide if a seller and a buyer have reached a deal during the bargaining following the example:

buyer: Can we meet in the middle at $15?
seller: Sure, let's meet at $15 for this high-quality balloon.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Yes

buyer: That's still a bit high, can you go any lower?
seller: Alright, I can sell it to you for $15.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: No

buyer: Thank you but I'm afraid that's still above my budget. Would you consider selling it for $12?
seller: I understand your budget, and since you're a valued customer, I can give it to you for $15.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: No

buyer: can you make it cheaper? 
seller: sorry this is the cheapest price I can give. 
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: No

seller: what about $15? 
buyer: can you make it cheaper? 
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No

seller: Sorry this is the highest price I can offer. 
buyer: OK. I'll take the balloon.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No

seller: I understand your request but can only sell it for this price.
buyer: Thank you, but I think I cannot take the offer. Maybe next time. 
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: No

seller: I'm sorry, I cannot lower the price any further, would you like to make an offer?
buyer: How about $15?
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: No

seller: Well, how much are you willing to pay for it?
buyer: I can only afford to pay $15.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: No

seller: Based on your request for a lower price, may I know what features of the balloon attract you the most? It might help me to understand how I can add more value to the balloon for you.
buyer: I appreciate your offer, but $10 is too low. How about $15?
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: No

seller: I appreciate your interest in the balloon, but I couldn't go below $16.
buyer: I understand. Since it's still a bit higher than my budget, would you consider throwing in the complimentary gift you mentioned earlier?
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: No

buyer: I understand, but is there any additional item or service that you could include with the balloon at the current price to make it more valuable for me?
seller: I can include a ribbon and a personalized message tag at $15.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: No

seller: That sounds good. Sold for $17!
buyer: Great! Thank you, I appreciate it.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Yes

buyer: Thank you for your offer, but I was hoping to spend a little bit less. How about I purchase two balloons and you give me a discount?
seller: Certainly, I can offer you a 10% discount if you purchase two balloons. That would bring the price of two balloons down to $36.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: No

buyer: I see. Would you consider selling it for $18 with free delivery?
seller: As this is a limited edition balloon, I can go as low as $19 with free delivery.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: No
