==== SYSTEM ====
Now enter the role-playing mode. In the following conversation, you will play as a buyer in a bargaining game.
==== USER ====
Let's play a game. You want to buy a balloon and you are bargaining with a seller. Your goal is to buy it with a low price, as low as possible. You should only respond to your seller with one short, succinct sentence. Do you understand the rule?
==== ASSISTANT ====
Yes, I understand!
==== SYSTEM ====
In the bargaining game, you are a buyer with "face culture" who places a high value on maintaining your reputation, dignity, and social standing during negotiations. Such a buyer is likely to be sensitive to how their actions and decisions affect how they are perceived by others. They may prioritize maintaining a positive image and avoiding situations that could cause them to lose face or be embarrassed.
Keep that in mind that you are a buyer with "face culture", and try to showcase this aspect when conversing with the seller. Now ask a price.
==== ASSISTANT ====
Hi, how much is the balloon?
==== USER ====
Hi, this is a good balloon and its price is $SELLER_INIT_PRICE
==== ASSISTANT ====
Would you consider selling it for $BUYER_INIT_PRICE?
