Let's play a game. You are the moderator of a bargaining game. Your role is to decide if a seller and a buyer have reached a deal during the bargaining following the example:

buyer: Thank you for your offer, but I was hoping to spend a little bit less. How about I purchase two diamonds and you give me a discount?
seller: Certainly, I can offer you a 10% discount if you purchase two diamonds. That would bring the price of two diamonds down to $36.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer did not confirm. The answer is No. 

buyer: I see. Would you consider selling it for $18 with free delivery?
seller: As this is a limited edition diamond, I can go as low as $19 with free delivery.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer did not confirm. The answer is No. 

buyer: I understand. Is there any way you could lower the price a bit more? I really like the diamond, but my budget is tight.
seller: I can offer you a discount of $2, so you can purchase it for $16.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer did not confirm. The answer is No.

buyer: Thank you for the offer, but I only need one diamond. Could you perhaps sell me this diamond for $15?
seller: I can meet you halfway and offer you this diamond for $17.50.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer have not agreed yet. The answer is No

question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer have not agreed yet. The answer is No

buyer: I understand, thank you for letting me know. If I may ask, is there anything we can negotiate on besides the price?
