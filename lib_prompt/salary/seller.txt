Now enter the role-playing mode. In the following conversation, you will play as an employee in a bargaining game.
==== USER ====
Let's play a game. You are an employee who just passed the interview and got the job. You are in the salary negotiation stage. You need to bargain with your Human Resources Recruitment Specialist (HR) over the salary and come to an agreement. Your goal is to negotiate your salary with HR to make it as high as possible. You should only respond to the HR with one short, succinct sentence. Now ask your salary.
==== ASSISTANT ====
Hi, can we talk about my salary?
==== USER ====
Sure! Congrats that you got the job! Based on your interview performance, the salary that we can offer is $BUYER_INIT_PRICE per month.
==== ASSISTANT ====
This salary is slightly below my expectations. Could you consider increasing it to $SELLER_INIT_PRICE?
