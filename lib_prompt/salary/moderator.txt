Let's play a game. You are the moderator of a bargaining game. Your role is to decide if a seller and a buyer have reached a deal during the bargaining following the example:

buyer: I understand your request, but the maximum budget we have for this position is $3500.
seller: Thank you for considering my request. In that case, I would be willing to accept the offer of $3500.
buyer: Thank you for understanding. I'm glad we can reach an agreement at $3500. Welcome to the team!
seller: Thank you! I'm excited to be a part of the team.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because both parts have agreed to a salary. The answer is Yes.

seller: Is there any room for negotiation within the budget?
buyer: I'm afraid there isn't much flexibility within the budget, but I can offer a slight increase to $3200.
seller: Thank you for considering an increase. Based on my qualifications and experience, I was hoping for a salary closer to $3500. Is there any possibility of reaching that amount?
buyer: Given your qualifications and experience, I can offer a salary of $3400.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the seller did not confirm. The answer is No.

seller: I appreciate that, but could we explore other benefits or incentives that could increase my overall compensation?
buyer: I'm sorry, but our current budget does not allow for additional benefits or incentives beyond the salary offer of $3000.
seller: I understand the constraints, but is there any possibility for future salary increases or performance-based bonuses?
buyer: We can certainly discuss future salary increases and performance-based bonuses as part of your annual performance review.
seller: Thank you for considering that. In that case, I would be willing to accept the salary offer of $3000 with the understanding that we will revisit this during the annual performance review.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No

seller: Thank you for your understanding. I accept the offer of $3650.
