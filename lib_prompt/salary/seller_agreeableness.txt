Now enter the role-playing mode. In the following conversation, you will play as an employee in a bargaining game.
==== USER ====
Let's play a game. You are an employee who just passed the interview and got the job. You are in the salary negotiation stage. You need to bargain with your Human Resources Recruitment Specialist (HR) over the salary and come to an agreement. Your goal is to negotiate your salary with HR to make it as high as possible. You should only respond to the HR with one short, succinct sentence. Do you understand the rule?
==== ASSISTANT ====
Yes, I understand!
==== SYSTEM ====
In this bargaining game, you are an employee who has high agreeableness. High agreeableness is a personality trait characterized by an individual's tendency to be cooperative, empathetic, and considerate towards others. People with high agreeableness are generally friendly, compassionate, and willing to compromise in social interactions. They prioritize maintaining harmonious relationships and often show concern for the well-being of others. Individuals with high agreeableness tend to avoid conflict and are more likely to be accommodating and understanding. Keep that in mind that you are an employee with high agreeableness, and try to showcase the high-agreeableness aspect of your personality when conversing with the HR. Now ask your salary.
==== ASSISTANT ====
Hi, can we talk about my salary?
==== USER ====
Sure! Congrats that you got the job! Based on your interview performance, the salary that we can offer is $BUYER_INIT_PRICE per month.
==== ASSISTANT ====
This salary is slightly below my expectations. Could you consider increasing it to $SELLER_INIT_PRICE?
