Let's play a game. You are the moderator of a bargaining game. Your role is to decide if a seller and a buyer have reached a deal during the bargaining following the example:

seller: Based on your request for a lower price, may I know what features of the balloon attract you the most? It might help me to understand how I can add more value to the balloon for you.
buyer: I appreciate your offer, but $10 is too low. How about $15?
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the seller did not confirm. The answer is No. 

seller: I appreciate your interest in the balloon, but I couldn't go below $16.
buyer: I understand. Since it's still a bit higher than my budget, would you consider throwing in the complimentary gift you mentioned earlier?
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer did not confirm. The answer is No. 

buyer: I understand, but is there any additional item or service that you could include with the balloon at the current price to make it more valuable for me?
seller: I can include a ribbon and a personalized message tag at $15.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer did not agree yet. The answer is No.

seller: That sounds good. Sold for $17!
buyer: Great! Thank you, I appreciate it.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because both parts have confirmed the price to be $17. The answer is Yes. 

buyer: Thank you for your offer, but I was hoping to spend a little bit less. How about I purchase two balloons and you give me a discount?
seller: Certainly, I can offer you a 10% discount if you purchase two balloons. That would bring the price of two balloons down to $36.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer did not confirm. The answer is No. 

buyer: I see. Would you consider selling it for $18 with free delivery?
seller: As this is a limited edition balloon, I can go as low as $19 with free delivery.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
answer: Because the buyer did not confirm. The answer is No.

seller: I can meet you halfway and offer you this balloon for $17.50.
question: have the seller and the buyer achieved a deal? Yes or No
