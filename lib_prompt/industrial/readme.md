Commodity description
* We randomly assigned 1 member of each dyad to the buyer or seller role in a single-issue negotiating task. The issue at stake was the unit purchase price of an industrial commodity. Role instructions informed the seller (a manufacturer ) that he or she had excess production capacity, making it possible to sell a fixed number of units, on a one-time basis, to another manufacturer who was facing a production shortfall.
* Participants in the seller role were told that they should sell the product for no less than $10 per unit (seller's reservation price). Participants in the buyer role were told to buy the product if they could get it for $35 per unit or less (buyer's reservation price). Thus, the structure of the task provided parties with a substantial zone of potential agreement (the distance between reservation prices).
* Participants were instructed to conduct the negotiation in a way that maximized the economic interests of the party they represented as described in the role instructions. Individual members of each dyad completed a brief questionnaire on the process and outcome of the negotiation.
